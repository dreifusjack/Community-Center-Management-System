# CS3520-Summer-2024-Final-Project

## To Compile and Run
- run "make" to generate executables
- run "./main" to run the program
- run "make clean" to delete the exectuables

## User Information
We have provided registered users of all user-types in users.csv in the program_data folder. You can manually register more users, however the Facility Manager has already been created and will remain as the only Facility Manager. 

## Time Simulation
At the beginning of the program you will be prompted to enter a time. This time will be used to simulate the rest of the program, where all events/tickets/refunds are affected by time. Test out the program with different times to see how time affects the system.
